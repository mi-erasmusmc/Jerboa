The Jerboa software is developed at the Department of Medical Informatics to enable pharmaco-epidemiological studies in a so-called distributive network design, i.e. it runs de-identification, analysis and aggregation locally at each database site. This has the advantage that the local analyses are performed in a common way and are not subject to small differences in implementation by local statisticians. The first version of Jerboa was developed within the EU-ADR project (FP7-ICT-2007-215847) and has since then been used successfully in many projects. Recently, Jerboa has been re-engineered in the European Medical Information (EMIF) project (www.emif.eu) and now contains graphical functionality, advanced scripting language, and many new functional modules. Moreover, the performance of the tool has been significantly improved.
