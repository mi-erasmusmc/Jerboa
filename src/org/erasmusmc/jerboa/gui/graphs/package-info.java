/**
 * This package contains a collection of different types of graphical representation
 * of the data. Each type of graph provides the methods necessary to achieve a graph
 * representation of the data that is fed by the user and/or application during the processing steps.
 * The classes present in this package are used only when the application is running in
 * GUI mode and they should contain all the necessary methods able to represent
 * any data that is their input (as a bag or list of bags structure) under a graph form.
