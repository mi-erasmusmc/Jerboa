 * This package represents a collection of statistical formulas that are used in different calculations across
 * a given work flow. Each one of the classes/formulas should contain a link towards a standardized representation
 * of the actual implemented formula. If derivations of the original/standard formula are made, they should be
 * motivated and documented.
