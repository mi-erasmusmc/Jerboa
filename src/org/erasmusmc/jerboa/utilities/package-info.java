/**
 * Provides the classes that contain the necessary methods used/assisting in
 * the manipulation/enhancement of the data processing steps and the data classes of the API
 * as well as user feed-back. These classes should represent a collection of the necessary utilities that are to be used
 * in multiple/different parts of the software, facilitating I/O handling, data compression, user feed-back, etc.
 * The methods falling under these classes should also provide testing units, as most of them are to be
 * reliable processing features taking part in / forming the internal mechanism of the application.
